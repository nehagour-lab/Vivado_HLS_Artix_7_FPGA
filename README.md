# Vivado_HLS_Artix_7_FPGA

Improved time complexity of matrix operations by implementing Xilinx HLS directives, resulting in a faster processing time and enabling real-time data analysis for critical applications.
Evaluated the effectiveness of the sequential approach versus the parallel approach by analyzing pipeline, unrolled, and array partition directives
Accomplished 3x3 matrix functions by conducting thorough testing and generating synthesis and bit stream reports on Artix-7 FPGA.
